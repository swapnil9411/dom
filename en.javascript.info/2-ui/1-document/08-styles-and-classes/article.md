# Styles and classes

Before we get into JavaScript's ways of dealing with styles and classes -- here's an important rule. Hopefully it's obvious enough, but we still have to mention it.

There are generally two ways to style an element:

1. Create a class in CSS and add it: `<div class="...">`
2. Write properties directly into `style`: `<div style="...">`.

JavaScript can modify both classes and `style` properties.

We should always prefer CSS classes to `style`. The latter should only be used if classes "can't handle it".

For example, `style` is acceptable if we calculate coordinates of an element dynamically and want to set them from JavaScript, like this:

```js
let top = /* complex calculations */;
let left = /* complex calculations */;

elem.style.left = left; // e.g '123px', calculated at run-time
elem.style.top = top; // e.g '456px'
```

For other cases, like making the text red, adding a background icon -- describe that in CSS and then add the class (JavaScript can do that). That's more flexible and easier to support.

## className and classList

Changing a class is one of the most often used actions in scripts.

In the ancient time, there was a limitation in JavaScript: a reserved word like `"class"` could not be an object property. That limitation does not exist now, but at that time it was impossible to have a `"class"` property, like `elem.class`.

So for classes the similar-looking property `"className"` was introduced: the `elem.className` corresponds to the `"class"` attribute.

For instance:

```html run
<body class="main page">
  <script>
    alert(document.body.className); // main page
  </script>
</body>
```

If we assign something to `elem.className`, it replaces the whole string of classes. Sometimes that's what we need, but often we want to add/remove a single class.

There's another property for that: `elem.classList`.

The `elem.classList` is a special object with methods to `add/remove/toggle` a single class.

For instance:

```html run
<body class="main page">
  <script>
*!*
    // add a class
    document.body.classList.add('article');
*/!*

    alert(document.body.className); // main page article
  </script>
</body>
```

So we can operate both on the full class string using `className` or on individual classes using `classList`. What we choose depends on our needs.

Methods of `classList`:

- `elem.classList.add/remove("class")` -- adds/removes the class.
- `elem.classList.toggle("class")` -- adds the class if it doesn't exist, otherwise removes it.
- `elem.classList.contains("class")` -- checks for the given class, returns `true/false`.

Besides, `classList` is iterable, so we can list all classes with `for..of`, like this:

```html run
<body class="main page">
  <script>
    for (let name of document.body.classList) {
      alert(name); // main, and then page
    }
  </script>
</body>
```

## Element style

The property `elem.style` is an object that corresponds to what's written in the `"style"` attribute. Setting `elem.style.width="100px"` works the same as if we had in the attribute `style` a string `width:100px`.

For multi-word property the camelCase is used:

```js no-beautify
background-color  => elem.style.backgroundColor
z-index           => elem.style.zIndex
border-left-width => elem.style.borderLeftWidth
```

For instance:

```js run
document.body.style.backgroundColor = prompt('background color?', 'green');
```

````smart header="Prefixed properties"
Browser-prefixed properties like `-moz-border-radius`, `-webkit-border-radius` also follow the same rule: a dash means upper case.

For instance:

```js
button.style.MozBorderRadius = '5px';
button.style.WebkitBorderRadius = '5px';
```
````

## Resetting the style property

Sometimes we want to assign a style property, and later remove it.

For instance, to hide an element, we can set `elem.style.display = "none"`.

Then later we may want to remove the `style.display` as if it were not set. Instead of `delete elem.style.display` we should assign an empty string to it: `elem.style.display = ""`.

```js run
// if we run this code, the <body> will blink
document.body.style.display = "none"; // hide

setTimeout(() => document.body.style.display = "", 1000); // back to normal
```

If we set `style.display` to an empty string, then the browser applies CSS classes and its built-in styles normally, as if there were no such `style.display` property at all.

````smart header="Full rewrite with `style.cssText`"
Normally, we use `style.*` to assign individual style properties. We can't set the full style like `div.style="color: red; width: 100px"`, because `div.style` is an object, and it's read-only.

To set the full style as a string, there's a special property `style.cssText`:

```html run
<div id="div">Button</div>

<script>
  // we can set special style flags like "important" here
  div.style.cssText=`color: red !important;
    background-color: yellow;
    width: 100px;
    text-align: center;
  `;

  alert(div.style.cssText);
</script>
```

This property is rarely used, because such assignment removes all existing styles: it does not add, but replaces them. May occasionally delete something needed. But we can safely use it for new elements, when we know we won't delete an existing style.

The same can be accomplished by setting an attribute: `div.setAttribute('style', 'color: red...')`.


## Mind the units

Don't forget to add CSS units to values.

For instance, we should not set `elem.style.top` to `10`, but rather to `10px`. Otherwise it wouldn't work:

```html run height=100
<body>
  <script>
  *!*
    // doesn't work!
    document.body.style.margin = 20;
    alert(document.body.style.margin); // '' (empty string, the assignment is ignored)
  */!*

    // now add the CSS unit (px) - and it works
    document.body.style.margin = '20px';
    alert(document.body.style.margin); // 20px

    alert(document.body.style.marginTop); // 20px
    alert(document.body.style.marginLeft); // 20px
  </script>
</body>
```

Please note: the browser "unpacks" the property `style.margin` in the last lines and infers `style.marginLeft` and `style.marginTop` from it.
